### Requirements

Conduct flight

1. Travel Distance: 160 kilometers
2. Payload capacity: 50,000 kilograms including rocket itself
3. Fuel capacity: 1,514,100 liters of fuel, already included in the payload total
4. Burn rate: 168,233 liters per minute
5. Average speed: 1500 kilometers/hr

Order

1. Enable stage 1 afterburner
2. Disengaging release structure
3. Cross-checks
4. Launch

1. Manually transition between launch stages in the expected order
2. Mission control should be able to safely abort launch after stage 1 and retry
3. One in every 3rd launch will require an abort and retry after stage 1, randomize when it actually happens
4. One in every 5th launch will explode, randomize when it actually happens

1. Total distance traveled (if aborted this would be 0, if exploded, pick a random spot in the timeline).
2. Total travel time (same as above)

1. Total distance traveled (for all missions combined)
2. Number of abort and retries (for all missions combined)
3. Number of explosions (for all missions combined)
4. Total fuel burned (for all missions combined)
5. Total flight time (for all missions combined)
