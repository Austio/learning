What do they think about the overall thing, analysis could be useful to someone at the company

How to do empathy interviews? https://tdi.org.au/customer-empathy-interviewing/
- Empathize and understand how and why they make certain decisions.  How it impacts whether they chose your brand, product or service.  Long face to face discussions where you listen.
- It is exploratory, think about your objectives, what are you trying to uncover and why.  How do you measure your answers.
- Your goal is to uncover behaviours and feelings of customers and potential customers.  What they do instead of what they could/would/should do.
1. Get them to describe existing or past behavior rather than future behavior.  
2. Leave questions open ended, it is about them.  "Have you thought about joining a gym, what if it was 10% off?" vs "Tell me what health means to you and how you stay healthy?"
3. Examples: Tell me a bit about..., describe the last time you...., what was it like when....   Ask why five times to get the real insight.

 - Awareness (What propted you to do x)
 - Consideration (What were alternatives, why)
 - Engagement (Why did you choose, how long)
 - Retention (How are you finding your experience with it?, will you continue?)
 - Advocacy (Would you recommend this brand to others) 

### General Thoughts

Need to be more forward looking and Strategic
 - have Vision from the Tech Leads

### On KPIs

Keep the KPI Consistent for a period of time

KISS ->
 - Increase topline while reducing bottom line
 - Better Results with Less

KPIs need to align with business

How to create
- Top Down: What are we measuring and what matters
- Bottom Up: How are we measuring

How efficiently am i running the business


Discovering Metrics: Find out what matters with higher ups

Would you mind sharing how you measure performance
If you had to measure performance on my group, how would you do it

For every critical resource
 - Business continuity plan, what if X leaves

## Think Big But Not Too Big

### Future Use Cases
 - Take features you are getting, assume success, what in 3-5 years are "nearby" problems it can subsume (those things growing slower)
 - Observations of "what is inevitable" and then what "bet" should we take in light of it
 
### Current Use Cases
 - New must have future use case and 3 of the following
 - Much Higher Reliablitiy 
 - Large Wins in Cost Efficiency (50% more than 10%)
 - Fundamental Featuree Capabilities Current System Can't Do
 - Impore engineering efficiency of adding other features
 
### Thinking too big
 - Everyone agrees, management is interested, but is too long, multi-year plan, year 1, duplicate, year 2, rollout, year 3 work on new features
 
### Highlight Short Term wins
 - Marginal value, 12 month, bones of architecture, deliver on scope
 
 When picking KPI
  - What things are important to me now?
  - Want KPIs that are limited
