### Chapter 10 - Relevance Centered Enterprise

*You likely don't know what users deem relevant*

 - User-Focused Culture, that bends over backwards to bring accurate and precise user feedback to guide work
 - For search, good user data is often unavailable or hard to interpret
   - making scientifically valid claims about data is hard, making about how people think/feel is harder still
 - Traditional metrics like click/purchases don't necessarily mean a good search relevance experience
   - eg: Users may buy mediocre, barely relevant result b/c the relevance one never comes up
   - For example: A user search for "Rosa rubiginosa" and buys a violet that is in the results b/c roses do not
 - Rely on content curators (QA, domain expert) to help understand the users expectation
 
TO measure, you must understand user context, domain expertise and business requirements

Use Relevance testing to make sure search is still working
 - Judgment List: For each search, individual results given a grade
 - Assertion Based: TDD Style
 
You need colleagues to get in head of users using behavioral data and also use that data to realign colleagues understanding of what users expect from it.
